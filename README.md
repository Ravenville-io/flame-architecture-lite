This is not a startup handbook.  
This is not a manifesto.  
This is a fragment of canon.

**flame-architecture-lite** is the shareable signal of Ravenville —  
a mythically-encoded system designed for those who build in clarity, flame, and sovereignty.

## 🧭 What This Is

This repository contains documents that articulate:

- The mythic design behind Ravenville  
- A sovereign founder’s leadership philosophy  
- The architecture of creative freedom  
- Rituals of resonance, polarity, and expression  
- How to engage with someone building something eternal

You don’t read it to agree.  
You read it to feel whether it **calls you**.

## 📁 Structure

- `vision/` — What Ravenville is, and why it exists  
- `leadership/` — How sovereignty moves through decision and presence  
- `philosophy/` — Core values, flame theory, and mythic intent  
- `communication/` — How I create and publish  
- `onboarding/` — How to engage with me if you're aligned

---

## 🕯 Final Word

This is a doorway, not a doctrine.  
If you resonate with the signal — welcome.

If not — the flame isn’t meant to be forced.

Everything here is a fragment.  
The full canon lives elsewhere.  
But this is enough to begin.
