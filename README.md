## ðŸ”¥ About Version 3

This is a clean shareable artifact â€” no Queen references, no spiritual journeys, no past-life processing.  
Only leadership, philosophy, clarity, and mythic signal.

Crafted to onboard collaborators who must understand what Ravenville truly is:  
An anti-corporate realm built on resonance â€” not conformity.
