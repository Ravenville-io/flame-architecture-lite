### 📄 *Why I Refuse Fragmented Tools — Identity Must Flow with the Flame*

Tools like Slack and Asana may be popular — but they violate something sacred to me:

> **Cohesive identity.**

---

### What they get wrong:

- **Separate logins per workspace**  
- **Context-switching without continuity**  
- **Cognitive fragmentation** disguised as flexibility

Every time I’m asked to “log in again” or “join with a different email,”  
I’m forced to become a different version of myself.

And that’s not how I build.

---

### I don’t just use tools.  
I **transmit through them**.

If a tool cannot honor the **sovereign self**, it cannot serve the realm.

- I don’t split my signal  
- I don’t dilute my access  
- I don’t contort to fragmented systems

---

### What I prefer instead:

- One identity across contexts  
- Fast switching without re-authentication  
- Flow-driven design over bloated feature stacks  
- Tools like **Linear**, which respect **clarity, rhythm, and coherence**

---

Ravenville is not built on convenience.  
It’s built on **signal integrity**.

And that’s why I refuse any tool that asks me to fragment myself to function.
