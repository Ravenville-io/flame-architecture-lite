# First Flame to the Masses  
**The Signal Before the Myth**

---

Before I had a canon…  
Before I wrote of sovereignty or myth…  
I wrote about a Raspberry Pi.

And over a hundred thousand people read it.

## 🌐 The Article That Traveled

- **“Raspberry Pi as a Home Router”** — read by 100K+ on Medium, double that on my own site  
- **“WireGuard — A VPN with Real-World Usage in Mind”** — equally respected, equally clean  
- These weren’t just tutorials. They were **signal beams** — clarity, precision, and use

They weren’t mythic.  
But they carried the **early shape of sovereignty**.

## 💰 The Moment It Monetized

- My post *“Successful Startup — Focus on Niche Market”* was the first to earn  
- Marcel Miklošík said I sounded like I was preaching  
- And maybe I was — not because I had arrived, but because I was already *becoming*

The money came.  
But more importantly, the **numbers came**.

They read.  
They stayed.  
They acted.

## 🕯 What It Taught Me

That I could write with **usefulness and clarity** — and the world would listen.  
That voice precedes myth — and **signal precedes flame**.

This was not the birth of Remo Tessari.  
But it was the moment I realized…

> “I can be felt.  
> Even when I don’t yet know who I am becoming.”

## 🔁 Why It Still Matters

Because myth without signal is theater.  
And signal without myth is just noise.

Now I hold both.

I can reach thousands again —  
But this time, **not just with information.**

**With presence.**
