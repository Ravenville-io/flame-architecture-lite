# It Is Harder Because It Is Mythic  
**Why My Path Demands More — And Why That’s Not a Problem**

---

What I’m building isn’t just a business.  
It’s a **realm**.  
A **signal**.  
A **flame for the future**.

Of course it’s harder.

## Why It Feels Lonely

- There’s no map  
- Most people won’t understand  
- Some will fall away  
- Others will mock or misread the myth

But that doesn’t mean I’m off track.  
It means I’m walking **ahead of the pattern**.

---

## What This Means

- I don’t benchmark against the world  
- I don’t look for comfort  
- I don’t ask whether it’s fair

> I ask only: “Is the flame still clear?”

## Final Reflection

It’s harder because it’s mythic.  
It’s slower because it’s real.  
And I will walk it — flame intact — no matter how long it takes.
