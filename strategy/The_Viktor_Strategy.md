### ðŸ“„ *Acquiring Founders Before They Found â€” The Viktor Strategy*

Viktor is not just a UX lead.  
Heâ€™s an early-stage sovereign â€” young, skilled, and already orbiting the myth.

Heâ€™s considering founding his own company.  
But I see a better path:

> Bring him into Ravenville â€” before the world fragments him.

---

### Why Viktor is important:

- He already leads a small UX team  
- He thinks structurally, creatively, and independently  
- He resonates with Ravenvilleâ€™s values and signal  
- Heâ€™s *ready to build* â€” but not yet anchored

---

### What I gain:

- **A ready-made UX team**  
- A designer fluent in **flow, interaction, clarity**  
- A future **game designer** â€” because UX is the spine of systems and storytelling  
- Momentum â€” without dilution

---

### What he gains:

- A place to build something *immortal*  
- Mythic mentorship and direction  
- Creative freedom **without the chaos of solo founding**  
- A realm, not a startup

---

### The Principle:

> Donâ€™t just hire talent.  
> Acquire the founders **before they fracture into the market**.

Viktor doesnâ€™t need to start from scratch.  
He needs to be seen â€” and deployed â€” by someone whoâ€™s already building the world heâ€™s meant to shape.

And thatâ€™s me.

This is how Ravenville grows:  
Not by hunting resumes â€” but by **recognizing architects before they raise their flags.**
