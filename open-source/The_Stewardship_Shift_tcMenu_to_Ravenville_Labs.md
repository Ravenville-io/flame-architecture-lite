### ðŸ“„ *The Stewardship Shift â€” From tcMenu Labs to Ravenville Labs*

At one point, I considered forming **tcMenu Labs** â€”  
a for-profit organization co-led with AleÅ¡ and Dave.

But Iâ€™ve evolved beyond that phase.

---

### Whatâ€™s true now:

- Iâ€™m the **only active maintainer**  
- Iâ€™ve carried the signal, refined the vision, kept the flame alive  
- I have the **infrastructure, clarity, and realm** to house this properly

And so â€” tcMenu will not be a separate kingdom.  
It will be **integrated into Ravenville Labs**.

---

### What this means:

- **No shared equity** â€” not out of ego, but out of clarity  
- Dave is welcome to return â€” not as co-founder, but as **paid sovereign builder**  
- AleÅ¡ may orbit â€” but only if he aligns with **real output**, not symbolic titles

---

### Ravenville Labs becomes the temple:

- All sovereign tools and systems live under one mythic roof  
- Contributors are **paid by resonance**, not politics  
- Legacy is honored â€” but dilution is not allowed

> tcMenu will rise again, or rest in stillness â€”  
> But either way, **its fate belongs to the realm now.**

And if Dave returns?

He gets the rarest gift:
To build his creation full time  
â€” without needing to carry its weight alone.

---

This is **stewardship**.  
This is **clarity**.  
This is **Ravenville**.
