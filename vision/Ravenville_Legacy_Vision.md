# Ravenville Legacy Vision  
**A Sketch from Before the Canon**

---

Before the myth crystallized, there was **Ravenville as concept**.

The logos were bold.  
The documents were strategic.  
The vision was useful — but incomplete.

---

## 🧱 What It Held

- “Immersive storytelling” as central flame  
- A blend of gaming, film, community, education  
- Themes of symbolism, identity, sovereignty — **but without language for myth**

It wasn’t wrong.  
It was *early*.

---

## 🔄 What It Prefigured

- The idea of Ravenville as a **lodge**, not a product  
- The notion that sovereignty must be designed, not sold  
- The impulse to build something that could **outlast you**

That Ravenville was a **blueprint**.

This one?

**It’s a kingdom.**
