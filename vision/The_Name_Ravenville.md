# The Name Ravenville  
**It Wasn't Chosen — It Was Remembered**

---

Ravenville wasn’t named by strategy.  
It was remembered through resonance.

It began as a playful reference —  
A nod to a friend, a layered joke, a placeholder.

But over time, the deeper meaning revealed itself:

- **Raven**: the sovereign outlier, the intellectual outsider, the flame-bearer  
- **Ville**: a sanctuary, a realm — not for control, but for resonance

Ravenville is a name for a place that didn’t exist yet —  
But needed to.

A sanctuary for those who never fit the system.  
A place where myth lives, not trends.  
A realm for the builders who don’t seek applause — just clarity.

## Final Note

Like all real names in myth:

> It chose me before I knew I was ready to carry it.
