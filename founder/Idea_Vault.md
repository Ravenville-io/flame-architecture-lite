# Idea Vault (Lite Canon)

This document contains a distilled selection of legacy business ideas aligned with the sovereign and technical foundations of Ravenville. These are not necessarily to be pursued, but may serve as inspiration or proof of evolutionary depth.

## Notable Refined Ideas

### 1. Private Cloud or GitHub Alternative
- Secure, sovereign infrastructure with seamless Git integration.
- Usable internally by Ravenville Labs and externally by other sovereignty-minded developers.
- Potential bridge to open-source contributions.

### 2. Video and Stream Hosting Platform
- Focused on content not allowed on mainstream platforms.
- Aligned with creative freedom, storytelling, and high-bandwidth resilience.
- Ideal for Ravenville Academy recordings, games, or immersive storytelling assets.

### 3. Hardware Development Division
- Exploration of decentralized, open-hardware platforms.
- IoT and embedded systems optimized for sovereignty.
- Builds upon userâ€™s software and firmware experience.

### 4. Idea Licensing and Brain Trust
- Archive and license unused high-signal business ideas to trusted partners.
- Revenue stream without direct execution.

These ideas reflect the user's long-standing visionary thinking, with modern context added for canon integration.
