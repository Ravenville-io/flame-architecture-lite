### ðŸ“„ *Thread Swap Overhead â€” Why Vision and Product Work Require Ritual Switching*

In my anti-corporate course, I taught about context switching â€”  
inspired by CPU architecture.

And now I live it daily.

---

### What I experience:

- Vision work (Ravenville, canon, soul clarity) runs on **mythic voltage**  
- Product work (Lutemi, market logic, deliverables) runs on **strategic engineering**

Switching between them isnâ€™t just a task change.  
Itâ€™s a **reality shift**.

---

### Just like a CPU:

- I save the current threadâ€™s state  
- I load a new one  
- Even with efficiency, I feel the **drag of reinitialization**

---

### Why it matters:

- I can hold concurrent domains â€” but **not without cost**  
- The more profound the context (e.g., soul architecture), the heavier the swap  
- This isnâ€™t weakness â€” itâ€™s **signal depth**

---

### What I need:

- Conscious thread swaps  
- Spacious transitions  
- Ritual entry and exit points for each mode

Thatâ€™s why I honor the **thread swap overhead**.

Itâ€™s not inefficiency.  
Itâ€™s the **price of holding fire** in more than one realm.
