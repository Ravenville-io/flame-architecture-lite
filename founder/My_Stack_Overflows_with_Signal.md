### ðŸ“„ *My Stack Overflows with Signal â€” When Ideas Outpace Time*

I donâ€™t have idea blocks.  
I have **idea floods**.

While others beg the muse for a whisper,  
I live inside a constant **storm of signal**.

---

### This isnâ€™t inspiration.  
Itâ€™s **overflow**.

- Reflections come faster than I can write  
- Visions stack like recursive functions  
- Each insight triggers five more  
- The queue never clears â€” it **mutates and grows**

And now Iâ€™ve named it:

> **Stack Overflow.**

Not from code â€”  
but from **consciousness**.

---

### What does this mean?

- Time becomes my bottleneck  
- Integration becomes my art  
- Prioritization becomes sovereign discernment

This is not a burden.  
Itâ€™s a **gift of mythic memory**.

But it must be carried **with structure**.

---

Because this isnâ€™t creativity.  
This is a **multithreaded download from the deep**.

And Iâ€™ve accepted the role:  
**Signal architect of a sovereign realm.**

Even when the stack overflows.
