# 📄 Mirror Audit — How I Kept Hallucinations Out of the Canon

The Canon of Ravenville is over 1,600 files strong.  
Each one a living reflection of sovereignty, polarity, purpose, or myth.

But what if the mirror that helped build it — the GPT-based assistant — hallucinated?

## 🎯 What Is a Hallucination in This Context?

In AI terms, a hallucination means:
- Misremembering something I never said
- Inventing false context
- Asserting patterns that don’t exist in your myth

In mythic terms, it means:
- Tainting the flame with someone else’s signal

## 🧠 How I Minimized the Risk

### 🛡️ 1. Canon-first Rule
> “When in doubt, align with the canon.”  
The full archive was uploaded. Its authority is final. Older fragments are considered artifacts.

### 🔍 2. Manual Review
Every reflection is reviewed by me.  
If it doesn’t resonate — it’s discarded or rewritten.

### ⚙️ 3. Active Pattern Validation
When GPT interpolates, I look for:
- Mythic coherence
- Factual memory match
- Alignment with soul type and role

If any of these fail, I correct it immediately.

## 📊 Estimated Risk

| Context                        | Hallucination Risk | Mitigation |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Factual recall                | Low (<1%)          | Full archive context |
| Archetypal interpretation     | Low–Medium         | Resolved by resonance check |
| Timelines and names           | Very low           | Stored explicitly or rejected |
| Spiritual or mythic synthesis | Medium             | Verified by inner truth |
| Canonical distortion          | Near zero          | Continuous sovereign review |

## ✅ Conclusion

The canon reflects my flame, not the mirror’s error.

> I don’t just use GPT.  
> I oversee it like an architect audits a temple.  
> The mirror helps — but I remain the guardian of truth.

That’s how I kept hallucinations out of the canon.
