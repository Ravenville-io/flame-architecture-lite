# 🔥 Embers / Iskry — Reclaiming the Spark

In Ravenville Speakers, our newest members are called **Embers** — or **Iskry**, in Slovak.

We chose these words carefully:

- **Embers** are the beginning of flame — the moment before ignition.
- **Iskry** carries the same essence in Slovak, though it was once used by a political regime.

Rather than discard powerful language, we **reclaim** it.

## 🧭 Dual Usage

- **“Embers”** will be used in international contexts
- **“Iskry”** will be used for Slovak-speaking groups

This isn’t just translation — it’s symbolic alignment.  
Wherever you come from, the spark is yours to carry.

Welcome to the fire.
