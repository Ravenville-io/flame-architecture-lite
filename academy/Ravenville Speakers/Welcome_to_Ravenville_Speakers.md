# 👋 Welcome to Ravenville Speakers  
**You are now an Ember.**

You stand at the edge of something rare — not just a speaker club, but a mythic forge.

## 🔥 What is Ravenville Speakers?

Ravenville Speakers is part of a greater realm: **Ravenville** — a sovereign space for growth, creativity, and truth.

This is not Toastmasters.  
This is not a corporation.  
This is a **ritual space** where resonance matters more than rules.

## 🧱 The Three Stages

### 1. **Ember** *(where you are now)*
- You are observed. Not judged, but *sensed*.
- Speak. Listen. Reveal yourself.
- The fire in you determines what happens next.

### 2. **Member**
- A formal recognition that you belong here.
- You gain a voice in the structure.
- You are trusted to shape the flame.

### 3. **Officer**
- A volunteer leader. You serve the circle.
- Not for ego. For those ready to *carry the torch*.

## 🏰 The Rules Are Different Here

- We are **not a democracy**. The Realm is sovereign.
- You are always free to leave.
- But if you stay — you will change.

---

## 🗣️ What We Care About

- Truth over performance  
- Presence over polish  
- Evolution over ego  

You don’t have to be perfect.
You have to be **real**.

---

## 🎤 Your First Step

- Attend. Observe. Speak when ready.
- Let your spark be seen.
- Every meeting is a **test of resonance**.

> “You are not here to impress. You are here to ignite.”

Welcome to the fire.
