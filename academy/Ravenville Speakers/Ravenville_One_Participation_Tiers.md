# 📄 Proposal: Handling Non-Members in Ravenville One

## 🔍 The Challenge

Ravenville One is a space of deep resonance and initiated membership.  
But not all who attend are full members — yet.

We need a clear, respectful, and mythically-aligned system to handle:

- Those who attend regularly
- Show potential resonance
- But haven’t yet been formally initiated

---

## 🌀 Proposed Tier System

### 1. **Witnesses** (Placeholder Term)

**Definition**: Individuals who attend Ravenville One but are not full members.

#### ✅ Rights:
- Unlimited attendance to Ravenville One sessions
- Ability to contribute reflections and participate in open dialogues
- Inclusion in public-facing rituals or workshops

#### ❌ Limits:
- No decision-making power
- Excluded from inner flame rituals or strategic planning
- Cannot lead segments unless explicitly approved

---

### 2. **Initiation Path to Membership**

Becoming a full **Member** includes:
- Continued presence over time
- Resonance recognition by existing members
- Private interactions or moments of deeper alignment
- A formal welcome ritual (e.g., *“The Circle has heard you. Welcome.”*)

---

### 3. **Exit or Redirection Paths**

If, after a period, resonance is not mutual or clear:
- The individual may be gently rerouted
- Potential suggestions: Toastmasters clubs, personal mentorships, or other aligned groups

> “This was a sacred crossing. We see you. This path may not be yours — yet.”

## 🏷️ Naming Suggestions for Non-Members (To Be Finalized)

- **Embers** — sparks outside the flame
- **Watchers** — present, observing, not yet initiated
- **Outer Circle**
- **Seekers**
- **Pilgrims**
- **Listeners**
- **Echoes**

Each of these holds mythic weight. The final choice should reflect the resonance and tone of Ravenville One.
