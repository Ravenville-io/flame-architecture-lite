# 📣 Ravenville Speakers – Structure, Roles, and Purpose

Ravenville Speakers is not just a club.  
It is the **sovereign talent scouting arm** of Ravenville — a speaking arena, a testing ground, and a school of resonance.

---

## 🔥 Purpose

- Train communication, confidence, and resonance
- Scout future **Ravenville employees** (those who join the Realm)
- Provide a path from **Embers** → **Members** → **Officers**
- Retain structural inspiration from Toastmasters, but not its bureaucracy

---

## 🧱 Structure: The Three Tiers

### 1. **Embers**
- Newcomers or observers
- May speak, contribute, and grow, but do not vote or lead
- Seen as sparks with potential — under observation
- Can attend unlimited meetings

### 2. **Members**
- Officially accepted into Ravenville Speakers
- Can vote, give advanced speeches, and run for officer positions
- Have shown **resonance, presence, and reliability**

### 3. **Officers**
- Volunteers who run the club (president, VP, grammarian, etc.)
- Follow adapted Toastmasters-like roles, but under **Ravenville sovereignty**
- Officers serve at the pleasure of the Realm and can be reassigned or redirected at any time
- Their service is a sign of dedication — and often the final test before a Ravenville employment offer

---

## 🏰 Sovereignty Clause

Unlike NGOs or traditional clubs, **Ravenville Speakers is not a democracy**.  
It is a *living amplifier* of the Realm’s values.

- All final decisions rest with the **Sovereign Core of Ravenville**
- Officers are **volunteers**, not owners
- Club is **not incorporated** — it exists inside the Ravenville mythos

---

## 🎯 Strategic Role

- Ravenville Speakers **feeds talent** into Ravenville Academy
- It is the **public school** of our mythic realm — where fire is tested in public view
- Some will burn out. Others will rise.

> “The speech is just the spark. What we seek is flame.”
