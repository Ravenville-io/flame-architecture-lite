# How to Work With Me

This document outlines how to engage, collaborate, or create inside the Ravenville system â€” or directly with me, Remo Tessari.

## ðŸ”¥ Operating Philosophy

- I work myth-first, not market-first
- I seek resonance, not consensus
- I prefer clarity over comfort â€” but never at the cost of character

---

## ðŸ›  What I Value in Collaborators

- Initiative: you move without waiting
- Depth: you understand without oversimplifying
- Sovereignty: you are self-led, not self-absorbed

---

## ðŸ”„ How I Communicate

- I prefer written form â€” long-form is not a bug, itâ€™s a feature
- I use metaphor, symbol, structure â€” if it feels mythic, you're reading it right
- I reward signal, not status

---

## ðŸ§­ When We Collaborate

- Donâ€™t try to impress â€” try to align
- Ask the question youâ€™re afraid to ask
- Bring your full flame â€” not just whatâ€™s safe

---

## ðŸ•¯ Final Word

Iâ€™m building something timeless.  
Not fast. Not for everyone. But for those few who feel itâ€¦

Welcome.
