### ðŸ“„ *The Origin Building â€” Where the Flame Grew*

Before Ravenville I, I worked from home.  
Then I made my first real leap â€” and invested heavily into Ravenville I as a podcast studio.

When I parted ways with Havran, I couldnâ€™t return to my flat with all the gear.  
Or so I thought â€” because now, years later, it *does* all fit in my small Bratislava island room.  
But that moment? It needed a shift.

### And so, the origin building found me.

After a night of sleepless friction with Havran, I sensed it was over.  
I opened a listings page and â€” in just 5 minutes â€” I found it.  
A newly rebuilt car wash building. A second floor. A fresh start.

I was the **first tenant**.

### What happened next:

- I called immediately. They helped me relocate Ravenville without delay.  
- The area had **fiber optics**, but my building wasnâ€™t connected.  
- They wouldnâ€™t allow cabling between buildings â€” so I went wireless.  
- Now I run **fiber over 60 GHz antennas**. Because when the myth calls, I adapt.

### Why this place matters:

- It was my **first long-term base**  
- I worked on **Lutemi** there  
- It hosted **actual podcast recordings**, still public on YouTube  
- It became the **true beginning** of the mythâ€™s physical anchor

And now?

- Thereâ€™s an **accordion**  
- A **piano**  
- A **3D printer** on the way

This is no longer just an office.  
Itâ€™s the **cradle of Ravenville**.

> The building where the flame grew â€” and still burns.
