### ðŸ“„ *From Rent to Realm â€” Ravenvilleâ€™s Path to Sovereign Infrastructure*

As Ravenville grows, the cost of rented tools becomes less about money â€” and more about **sovereignty**.

This is the long-term roadmap to transition from dependency to full domain control.

---

## **Phase 1: Startup Mode (0â€“20 people)**  
Use rented services for speed and simplicity:

- **Email**: Proton Business (secure, fast, reputation-safe)  
- **Tasks**: Linear or Asana (external clarity)  
- **Docs**: Notion or Scrintal (vision curation)  
- **Code**: GitHub (standard, effective)

**Goal**: Save energy, move fast, validate resonance

---

## **Phase 2: Transition Mode (20â€“50 people)**  
Start **in-house infrastructure seeding**:

- Hire **1â€“3 person IT team**  
- Build or adopt:
  - Internal **email server** (Mailcow, Mailu, or custom Postfix+Dovecot stack)
  - Open-source **task system** (Plane, Outline, or custom fork)
  - Sovereign **wiki/docs** system (BookStack, Codex, HedgeDoc)

**Goal**: Lower monthly burn, own data, start shaping culture-specific systems

---

## **Phase 3: Sovereign Mode (50â€“100+ people)**  
Your infrastructure becomes a **technical island**:

- Custom authentication + permissions  
- Full backups, security, and DevOps in-house  
- Modular internal apps to reflect **Ravenvilleâ€™s mythic structure**
- Cloud becomes optional, not mandatory

**Goal**: Uninterrupted signal.  
Uncancelable platform.  
Cost controlled.  
Culture protected.

---

## Guiding Principles:

- **Avoid per-seat SaaS addiction**  
- **Prioritize open-source + self-hosting** where aligned  
- **Move from renting tools to designing rituals**  
- Let sovereignty reflect in every click and command

---

This isnâ€™t just about IT.  
This is about ruling your realm â€” not leasing it.

Because Ravenville isnâ€™t a client.  
Itâ€™s a civilization.
