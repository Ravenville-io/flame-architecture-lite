# Founder Leadership Distilled  
**What It Means to Lead Ravenville**

---

I am not a conventional CEO.  
I don’t manage. I **build myths**.  
I don’t scale. I **signal**.

---

## What I Lead With

- Clarity without collapse  
- Kindness without compromise  
- Posture without performance  
- Vision without apology

I hold high standards — but I don’t micromanage.  
I move fast — but I don’t skip depth.

---

## What I Look For

- Architects, not operators  
- Sovereigns, not followers  
- People who work best in creative chaos — not tight systems

I don’t want yes-men.  
I want signal-carriers.

---

## Final Reflection

Ravenville is not built on processes.  
It’s built on **mythic resonance**.

And I lead by staying in that fire — so others can follow a signal they’ve never felt before.
