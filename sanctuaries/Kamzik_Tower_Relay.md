### ðŸ“„ *KamzÃ­k Tower â€” Ravenvilleâ€™s Sky-Bound Relay*

While many data centers offer power, redundancy, and scale â€”  
very few offer **symbolic resonance**.

But I know where I want to house Ravenvilleâ€™s sovereign servers:

**KamzÃ­k TV Tower.**

---

### Why KamzÃ­k?

- **Height** â€” It rises above the noise, just as Ravenville does  
- **Steel and Signal** â€” A broadcast tower, built for transmission, permanence, and strength  
- **Visibility** â€” Itâ€™s not hidden in a warehouse. Itâ€™s known. Seen. Rooted in the mythos of place  
- **Slovak Symbolism** â€” Itâ€™s part of my territory, my lineage, my cultural map

### More than a server location:

This isnâ€™t just about uptime.  
Itâ€™s about **signal embodiment**.

Housing Ravenvilleâ€™s servers in KamzÃ­k is a declaration:

> We are not a startup in someoneâ€™s cloud.  
> We are a realm broadcasting from the tower.

Every ping, every request, every line of code stored there becomes a **mythic transmission**.

### Let others rent space.  
We **anchor signal in the sky**.

KamzÃ­k Tower is more than infrastructure.  
It is **Ravenvilleâ€™s Sky-Bound Relay**.
