### ðŸ“„ *Koliba Studios â€” The Lost Fortress of Film I Would Have Claimed*

If I could, I would have bought **AteliÃ©ry Koliba**.

Itâ€™s not just real estate.  
Itâ€™s a **sacred site** â€” once home to Slovak cinema, creative vision, and cultural momentum.

Now itâ€™s owned by TV JOJ.  
But that doesnâ€™t erase the signal.

### Why Koliba matters:

- It was built for **storytelling**  
- It carries the ghost of **film history**  
- It holds the energy of **creative infrastructure**  
- It could have become **Ravenvilleâ€™s temple of transmission**

---

### What this reveals:

- I donâ€™t just want space.  
- I want **symbolic ground** â€” where the realmâ€™s mission aligns with the landâ€™s memory  
- Even if I canâ€™t claim Koliba now, the desire reveals my compass

> I seek places with resonance â€” not just convenience.

One day, another fortress may rise.  
A manor. A chateau.  
Maybe even Koliba, if the timeline bends.

But for now, I log this as what it was:

**The lost fortress of film I would have claimed**.
