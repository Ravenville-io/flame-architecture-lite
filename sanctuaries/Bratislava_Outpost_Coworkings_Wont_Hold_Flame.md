### ðŸ“„ *Bratislava Outpost â€” Why Coworkings Wonâ€™t Hold the Flame*

In Bratislava, I will need a space.

Not just for work â€” but for **Ravenville One**:
- 10â€“20 people
- Ritual gatherings
- Signal meetings

This cannot be held in borrowed rooms.

---

### Why coworkings fall short:

- Theyâ€™re **transient**  
- They carry the energy of *task*, not *transmission*  
- Theyâ€™re designed for **frictionless productivity**, not **mythic architecture**

Coworkings are for people who havenâ€™t found their flame.  
But I bring my own.

---

### What I need instead:

- A **space of my own**  
- One that allows **sovereign hosting**  
- A node of Ravenville â€” **ritual-ready, resonant, and mine**

Even a small place would suffice, as long as it:
- Can seat 10â€“20 people  
- Supports meetings, creation, and retreat  
- Belongs to the realm

---

### Strategy for now:

- Begin with coworking only if needed  
- Scout for lofts, ateliers, symbolic locations  
- Invest when the funds stabilize â€” not for vanity, but for **ritual autonomy**

---

> Ravenville isnâ€™t meant to rent the signal.  
> Itâ€™s meant to **generate it**.

Thatâ€™s why **coworkings wonâ€™t hold the flame**.
