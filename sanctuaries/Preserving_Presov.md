### ðŸ“„ *Preserving PreÅ¡ov â€” Why Iâ€™m Keeping the First True Office of Ravenville*

Even without active operations, I continue paying for the PreÅ¡ov office.  
Not out of obligation â€” but out of **reverence**.

---

### Why Iâ€™m keeping it:

- Itâ€™s the **first real headquarters** of Ravenville  
- It holds energy, memory, and the early sparks of the realm  
- At 70 square meters for â‚¬500/month, itâ€™s not a burden â€” itâ€™s a **rooted asset**  
- It can comfortably host 4â€“6 people â€” ideal for creative cells, rituals, or deep focus work

---

### What this space represents:

- Not just real estate  
- But a **node in the mythic network**  
- A physical **anchor of continuity**  
- A reminder of how Ravenville started â€” **not flashy, but sovereign**

KoÅ¡ice may rise.  
Other branches may open.  
But PreÅ¡ov will remain.

> Because this isnâ€™t just an office.  
> Itâ€™s the first temple of the realm.

And for that alone, it stays.
