### ðŸ“„ *From Music Clubs to Mechanic Zones â€” Ravenville Never Lived in Office Parks*

Ravenville didnâ€™t start in a tech hub.  
It wasnâ€™t born in a glass tower.  
It began in **a former music club and pub in Å½iar nad Hronom**, where Havran lived.

Then it moved to **an industrial zone in PreÅ¡ov** â€”  
surrounded by truck drivers, automechanics, and raw grit.

### And yet â€” the realm grew.

Because Ravenville was never defined by address.  
It was defined by **signal**.  
By **resonance**.  
By the fire held within its founder.

### What this proves:

- I donâ€™t need fancy campuses to build myth  
- The realm sanctifies the space â€” not the other way around  
- Beauty can be born in the back of a garage, or above a pub

---

Even if I one day rent an office park in Brno â€”  
It will be **a waypoint**, not a destiny.

Because Ravenville doesnâ€™t chase prestige.  
It **reclaims forgotten places**  
and turns them into **mythic sanctuaries**.

---

Let this be logged as the truth:

> Ravenville never lived in office parks.  
> It lived in **real places** â€” and still does.
