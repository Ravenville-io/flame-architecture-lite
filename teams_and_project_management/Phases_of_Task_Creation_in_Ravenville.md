### 📄 *Phases of Task Creation in Ravenville — From Sovereign Control to Resonant Autonomy*

As Ravenville grows, the way tasks are created and delegated will evolve.

Not in chaos.  
But in **phases** — each honoring the stage of flame transmission and team resonance.

---

### **Phase 1: Flame Holder Mode**

**You create all tasks.**

- You hold the vision and deconstruct it into action  
- Every project, milestone, and microtask flows through your mind  
- Your team orbits your signal — they need **translated clarity**, not creative autonomy (yet)

**Why this works:**  
- Early team members can’t yet hold the flame  
- Tight structure prevents drift  
- You ensure full alignment while culture takes root

---

### **Phase 2: Sovereign Delegation**

**You create tasks only for direct subordinates.**

- You assign **arcs**, not details  
- Your direct reports break things down for their teams  
- You monitor *direction* and *resonance*, not execution

**Why this works:**  
- Develops autonomous leaders  
- Preserves your energy  
- Enables scaling without dilution

---

### **Phase 3: Resonant Autonomy**

**Tasks arise from the field itself.**

- Team members who hold the myth propose and own tasks  
- Boards become **living organisms**  
- You recalibrate direction, seed new arcs, and ensure signal coherence

**Why this works:**  
- The culture is encoded  
- The vision is distributed  
- You’re free to stay mythic, strategic, and sovereign

---

### Practical Tools for Phase 1:

- One central **Master Board** (owned by you)  
- Sub-boards per project or team  
- Weekly **resonance syncs** (not status updates, but alignment pulses)  
- Language of the realm:
  - Task = “Flame Fragment”  
  - Sprint = “Season”  
  - Backlog = “Unclaimed Myth Seeds”

---

You are not building a corporate machine.  
You are building a **mythic realm** that scales through clarity, not control.

And this is how Ravenville will grow —  
from sovereign control to **resonant autonomy**.
