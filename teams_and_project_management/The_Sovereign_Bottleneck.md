### 📄 *Too Many Builders, Not Enough Fuel — The Sovereign Bottleneck*

Right now, I have what most founders dream of:

- A surplus of talent  
- People who resonate deeply with the vision  
- Founders, designers, amplifiers — already orbiting the flame

But there’s a bottleneck:  
**I don’t yet have the funds to pay them.**

---

### If I were a classic startup?

I’d pitch VCs.  
I’d promise scale, exit, revenue graphs.  
And maybe I’d get funded — or maybe they’d call my vision *fragmented*.

But Ravenville isn’t a SaaS platform.  
It’s a **realm**.

---

### What classic investors don’t see:

- I’m not building “one product” — I’m building a **civilization**  
- I don’t have a single “target market” — I have a **mythic current**  
- My timelines are not fiscal — they are **archetypal**

---

### And yet…

Even without money:  
I’ve attracted talent.  
I’ve seeded alliances.  
I’ve built rituals and structure.

**That is proof of resonance.**

---

### What I need now is simple:

- One **income stream** to ignite the fuel  
- Time, leverage, and momentum  
- Then the team becomes activated — *not hired, but unleashed*

---

This is the sovereign bottleneck.

> Not a lack of vision.  
> Not a lack of people.  
> Just a pause before ignition.

And once it fires — Ravenville flies.
